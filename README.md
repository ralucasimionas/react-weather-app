# Weather APP

While weather is sometimes difficult to predict, this app will give you the possibility to check the weather for any given city at a click and be prepared for it without looking out the window. Furthermore, it shows you a 5 day forecast, so that you won't have to worry about how the weather will be tomorrow... or the day after.
